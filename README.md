# Welcome to My Christmas Tree
***

## Task
Create a program which can be run in the terminal that displays a Christmas Tree.

## Description
The program was built using C language

## Installation
Run command "make" in the terminal. It will build the target file "my_tree"
```
make
```

## Usage
To run the program type in "./my_tree" and the size of the tree.  
If none or invalid size is given the program termminates.  
The size is limited to 15 tiers to look nice in the terminal and avoid overflows.  
(The tallest tree is 116 metres in Redwood National Park in California, USA. And we are not competing with it.) 

``` 
./my_tree 3
 ```
